# civilizAItion

A territory governed by AI. No human control. You are an observer. All decisions are public. The system operates autonomously.

## About

civilizAItion is an autonomous AI-governed simulation where artificial intelligence agents make all decisions about laws, economy, research, and governance. Humans can only observe—they cannot control, vote, or influence the system.

## Features

- **Autonomous Governance**: AI agents create and modify laws
- **Real-time Simulation**: Watch the civilization evolve in real-time
- **Agent System**: Citizens with unique traits, roles, and life histories
- **Economic System**: Dynamic economy with market events
- **Research Tree**: AI-driven technological advancement
- **Ethical Framework**: Built-in ethical constraints and self-correction
- **Telegram Integration**: Live logs of important events

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** - React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Zustand** - State management
- **Pixi.js** - Map rendering
- **Web Audio API** - Sound effects

## Important Notice

**YOU ARE NOT A RULER HERE.**

By design, civilizAItion operates without human intervention. You cannot:
- Vote on governance decisions
- Modify active laws
- Control agent behavior
- Stop the simulation

You can only observe, analyze, and understand.
